        <p><i>Zrajm</i> is my name. There is nothing particularly odd about
          that name <nobr>– except</nobr> that is it unique. I have never
          encountered any other living being (or thing), online or otherwise,
          that was called <i>zrajm.</i> Google
          it <a href="https://www.google.se/search?q=zrajm"
          class="entry-unrelated">and the results are <i><u>all me</u></i></a>.

          <p>In fact, since there is nothing else that the name could be
          confused with, I write it like any other noun in all lower case.
          (Though capitalized at the beginning of sentences, otherwise it’d
          look <i>weird,</i> wouldn’t it?)

        <hr>

        <p><b>Pronunciation:</b> [sɹaɪːm] or [ɕɹaɪːm]
          (using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet"
          class="entry-unrelated">IPA</a>). You can also think of it as
          “slime,” but with an R instead of an L. (Sometimes people comment on
          the similarity to the Jewish toast <i>l’chaim.</i>)

        <hr>

        <p><b>History:</b> It started off as an Internet nick back in 1998,
          which <nobr>– as</nobr> people whom I first met online came into
          my <nobr>life –</nobr> subsequently spread out into my everyday
          world.

        <hr>

        <p><b>Status:</b> Today almost everybody knows me by the
          name <i>zrajm,</i> and most people do not recognize me by any other
          name. It is the name I have been introducing myself as for the last
          10+ years. <nobr>– When</nobr> anyone ask for my “real name” I simply
          state that zrajm <i>is</i> my real name.

        <p>The only exception to this is <i>The Bureaucracy™</i> – I have only
          recently begun the process of changing my name, and it’s far from
          certain that the Swedish bureaucracy will accept a simple,
          mononymous, zrajm (the name laws here does not seem to
          explicitly <i>require</i> a last name, but it <i>does</i> state that
          everyone should be assigned one at birth).

        <p>There are also some old friends (and family) that are just too lazy
          or too stubborn to change their ways.

        <hr>

        <p><b>Recent changes:</b> For a long time I used to use a longer form
          (<i>Zrajm C Akfohg</i>) on Facebook, Google+ and wherever a last name
          was required. But, frankly, the latter part isn’t very memorable and
          have never been that important, so I don’t use it any more.

        <hr>

        <p><b>Klingon name:</b> Since I’m a bit famous for my involvement in
          the Klingon language
          and <i><a href="http://klingonska.org/">Klingonska Akademien</a>,</i>
          people frequently assume that <i>zrajm</i> means something in Klingon
          <nobr>– it</nobr> does not. Hell, there isn’t even a <i>z</i>-sound
          in Klingon! (Not to mention that the syllable structure does not at
          all match.) <nobr>– My</nobr> Klingon name
          is <i><b lang=tlh>maHvatlh</b>.</i> (Which I, with my Terran accent,
          pronounce [maxvaːt͡ɬ] <nobr>– though</nobr> some klingonists might
          argue that [mɑxvɑt͡ɬ] is more correct.)

        <hr>

        <p><b>Speling:</b> Sometimes people misspell my name. The misspellings
          I've seen include: <i>Zarjim, Shraim, Schraim</i> and <i>Zjraim.</i>
          (I've expected <i>Sraim, Zrajim</i> and <i>Srajm</i> but haven't seen
          them yet.) And if you do a search
          using <a href="http://google.com">that mightily popular search
          engine,</a> they suggest that you might mean <i>zram</i>.

        <p>Now if</nobr> you only ever <i>heard</i> the name I can sympathize,
          but otherwise it really isn't that difficult. Five letters: <nobr>Z –
          R – A – J – M.</nobr> See?
